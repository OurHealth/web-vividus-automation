When I wait `PT605S` with `PT300S` polling until element located `${xpathFor_StillWithUsAlertMsg}` becomes VISIBLE
Then the text '${textInStillWithUsPopup}' exists
When I wait until element located `${xpathFor_ExtendSessionButton}` appears
When I click on element located `${xpathFor_ExtendSessionButton}`
When I scroll context to TOP edge
